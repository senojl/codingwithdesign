		<div class="conceptbody"><p>I initially started off with research into language learning, communication, and from there landed in colloquialisms. I defined these communications as &#8220;social subtleties that human interaction&#8221;. While I was interested in these concepts, I became fascinated with programming languages, which are human constructs designed to communicate with machines, and moves further from my idea of communication with others, and more into constructed logic and syntax built around computers</p></div>

		<div class="evolution"><p>After doing research in teaching designers Android programming, I realized that I wanted to take a different approach, and looked into an app that described design based esoteric programming languages. I narrowed my research down into five esoteric coding languages, and started working on visual language, and the structure of the app and accompanying website.</p>

		<div class="exploreimg"><img src="appbegin.png"></div>

		<div class="explore"><p>My concept for the esoteric language app was to have an app that displayed each language and an example of their code in the form of a Hello World program. Then the website would display the design for the app compared to the code for the app. This would serve as an example of coding and design, which became the name for the app, Coding with Design. </p>

		<div class="colorexp"><p>I chose a color scheme made by Ethan Schoonover, called Solarized. This color scheme was originally made for text editors, and is used by many programmers. For type, I chose Futura and Andale Mono. I wanted to use a monospace to refer back to programming, and I wanted to use a mid-century sans-serif to continue in the theme I had chosen with the punch card from early programming.</p></div>

		<div class="finalexpl"><p>I realized that while the app served as an explanation of the esoteric languages, it didn't really connect with the ideas I was interested in, and it seemed separate from the website. I took inspiration from one of the esoteric languages called Magritte, and decided to make an app that served no purpose other than to display its code.</p></div>
