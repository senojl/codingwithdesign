		<div class="conceptbody"><p>This app is inspired by directly by Rene Magritte's <i>The Treachery of Images</i>, and explores the idea of technology and what it actually is. Like Magritte's work, the app states that it is not an app. When one clicks on the button that reads <i>"This is an app"</i>, they are taken to the code of the app. This examines the relationship between the app and the user, and how technology has become such a part of our lives, yet most people have never seen the "bones" of an app, or a website, or any of the software they come in contact with on a day to day basis. This app also serves no purpose for entertainment, knowledge, or ease of use as other apps exist to do, and while it technically is an app, it cannot help the user to perform other tasks.</p></div>
